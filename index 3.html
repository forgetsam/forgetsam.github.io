<p><h4>Uses of Therapy Animals</h4></p>
<p><h4>Pet Therapy</h4></p>
<p>Pet therapy or animal-assisted therapy is becoming a common way for health professionals</p><p>to improve patient’s social, emotional, and mental functioning with the support of animals.</p><p>These therapy animals range from cats and dogs to horses and dolphins.</p>
<p><h4>Schools</h4></p>
<p>Many colleges and universities bring therapy dogs to campus, often around mid-terms</p> <p>or finals, to help students relax and destress. Students say that interacting with these animals</p> <p>can be very mood lifting, especially if they have family pets they don’t often get to see. </p>
<p><h4>In Hospitals</h4></p>
<p>Many hospitals have formal or information programs to bring animals in for patients.</p> <p>Cedars-Sinai has a program called POOCH, where volunteer dogs visit patients that have requested a visit. </p>
<p><h4>After a Disaster</h4></p>
<p>Some organizations work both locally and nationally to send therapy animals to tragically affected areas.</p> <p>These therapeutic animals help people recover from physical ailments and emotional trauma.</p>
